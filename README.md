# Flutter 2 Boilerplate (version 1.3.0)

A boilerplate project created in flutter. Boilerplate supports both web and mobile. VSCode is recommended in this project.

Current Flutter Version : 2.5.3 

## Getting Started

The Boilerplate contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using boiler plate code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.

## Setting up the environment

Use this [guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for the setting up the flutter environment.

For web you will need [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com.au/intl/en_au/chrome/) to be installed on the system.
